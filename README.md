# Aurorae Chat Client

## What is Aurorae?

Aurorae is the name the llm gave itself :) It was pretty hard to force it to give itself a name but after prompt juggling a little bit it did what it needed to. However since the name is really poetic, I choose this tiny projects name shall be this one.

## How to get started?

This is just a small frontend nuxt application to handle the GPT4ALL llm. Check out this repository for the llm server which can connect to this frontend app:
